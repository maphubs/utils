# MapHubs Utils

Shared MapHubs util/service code

Moved to a seperate repo in order to support using bitsrc.io. This is a monorepo, individual packages are deploy to Bit at https://bitsrc.io/kriscarle/maphubs-utils/

Since Bit only supports a single compiler at the moment, the main MapHubs repo is configured for React component builds, and this repo handles generic JS builds
